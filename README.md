## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.


## Goals

### TODO
- tranclusion for the links between notes
- data stored in both graph nodes and graph edges
- automatic typing for the data entered on graph nodes and edges
- a query language for conducting computation on notes with the ability to pass data to external programs
- queries that generate notes and are run every time the notes used to generate the notes are modified or new ones are added
- backwards and forwards chaining rule engine logic
- quick template creation system for notes
- display system to make notes look nice
- version control
- sub-graphs as vertices so you can throw a connected group of data around as a single datum (collection of nodes should be a first class node)
- The ability to look at multiple notes at once
- Note tabs
- latex???
- publishing, importing. Partial export?
- VCS
- Synchronization
- Write in Clojure
- Collaboration
- drawings
- image embeds
